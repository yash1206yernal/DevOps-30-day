  - IAM (Users, Policies)
  - EC2 (Virtual Servers)
  - S3 (Storage Buckets)
  - VPC (Networking)

- Create resources using AWS Console and CLI

---

## 🔧 Tools Used:
- ✅ AWS Console (Web)
- ✅ AWS CLI (v2)
- ✅ Git Bash / Command Line
- ✅ Key Pair (`devops-key.pem`)
- ✅ Region used: `us-east-1` (can be changed)

---

## 🧪 Tasks Completed:

### 1️⃣ IAM & AWS CLI
- Created new IAM user with programmatic access
- Configured CLI using `aws configure` with access keys

### 2️⃣ EC2 Launch (via CLI)
- Fetched Amazon Linux 2 AMI ID
- Created Key Pair (`devops-key.pem`)
- Created Security Group (`devops-sg`) with SSH + HTTP access
- Launched EC2 instance
- Connected using:
```bash
ssh -i devops-key.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>

📚 Learnings
IAM enables access control & security for users/services.
EC2 provisioning & secure SSH is key to cloud infra setup.
S3 is the backbone of object storage in AWS.
VPC is core to networking; every resource is inside a VPC.
