# ‚úÖ Day 14 ‚Äì CI/CD Project (GitHub Actions)

## üìå What I Did

- Created a Dockerized Flask application (`app.py`)
- Wrote a `Dockerfile` to containerize the app
- Created a GitHub Actions pipeline in `.github/workflows/docker-ci.yml`
- Added secrets (`DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`) securely to GitHub
- Logged in to Docker Hub via GitHub Actions
- Built and pushed the Docker image automatically
