# âœ… Day 12 â€“ Jenkins Pipelines

## ðŸ“Œ What I Did
- Learned the difference between Freestyle Jobs and Pipeline Jobs
- Created a **Pipeline Job** in Jenkins
- Wrote and ran a **Declarative Jenkinsfile**
- Configured Jenkins to pull a `Jenkinsfile` from a **GitHub repo**
- Successfully executed a multi-stage pipeline

---

## ðŸ§± Jenkinsfile Structure

Created a Jenkinsfile with 3 stages:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'ðŸ”¨ Building from GitHub repo...'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'âœ… Testing from GitHub repo...'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'ðŸš€ Deploying from GitHub repo...'
            }
        }
    }
}
