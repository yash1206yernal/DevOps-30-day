DevOps is a combination of two words: "Development" and "Operations." Itâ€™s a modern approach where software developers and software operations teams work together throughout the entire software life cycle, from planning and coding to testing, deploying, and monitoring.

The main idea of DevOps is to improve the software delivery process. We achieve this by software release automation, continuous monitoring/logging and testing. The goals of DevOps are:

Faster and continuous software releases.
Reduces manual errors through automation.
Built-in Monitoring, detect failures or issues during delivery or in production.
Automate testing throughout the software delivery process.
