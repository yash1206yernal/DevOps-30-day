# âœ… Day 13 â€“ GitHub Actions CI/CD

## ðŸ“Œ What I Did
- Learned the fundamentals of GitHub Actions
- Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for automated CI
- Used GitHub-hosted runners to run shell commands
- Added a custom script (`greeting.sh`) as a pipeline step
- Verified successful execution in the GitHub Actions UI

```yaml
