# ✅ Day 6 – DevOps Lifecycle Deep Dive

## 🔄 DevOps Lifecycle Stages
- Plan → Develop → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor

## ⚙️ CI vs CD
- CI: Automatically test and build code after every commit
- CD: Deliver or deploy code automatically to staging or production

## 🚀 Release Strategies
- Blue-Green: Two environments, zero downtime switch
- Canary: Roll out gradually to a % of users, then expand
- Rolling Update: Replace instances/pods one by one

## 🔐 Shift-Left Testing
- Test and secure early (in CI)
- Tools: ShellCheck, SonarQube, Snyk, linters

## 🤝 Agile + DevOps Synergy
- Agile = faster iterations and feedback
- DevOps = automated build, test, deploy
- Together = fast, safe, continuous delivery

🚀 Day 6 is now complete ✅
